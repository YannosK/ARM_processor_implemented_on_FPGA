# Implementing an ARM processor on a Xilinx ZedBoard

This project was given to me in my MSc course on Digital Systems Design, by proffesors [N. Kranitis](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ps8mOuMAAAAJ&hl=en) and [A. Paschalis](https://scholar.google.gr/citations?user=q8LRbY4AAAAJ&hl=el)

The goal was to create a processor implementing some of the simple instructions of the ARM instruction set. Here I have the VIVADO directories and files generated, starting from the source code, following through all the design steps up to implementation
